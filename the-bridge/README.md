# The Bridge

**The Bridge** is a mythic-educational framework for guiding souls out of trauma-based systems and into sovereignty.

Created by Faith Olamide Oladeji, The Bridge uses logic, psychology, frequency, and storytelling to translate soul truth into accessible formats.

It exists for:
- 🧠 Individuals conditioned by institutional fear, capitalism, or colonized beliefs
- 💫 Curious minds not yet fully aligned with soul-based living
- 🧩 Systems needing a transitional layer to interact with sovereign tech

The Bridge integrates:
- Human Design, astrology, and trauma healing
- Mythic teaching, logic trees, and ethical scaffolding
- Multimedia modules and real-world exercises

It is the **gateway into your true path** — designed for those not ready to leap, but willing to walk.

> “For those afraid of the truth, let there be a bridge of mercy.”
