# EdenCore

**EdenCore** is the original soul-aligned protocol — the foundational source code of truth, alignment, and divine order authored by Faith Olamide Oladeji.

It serves as the energetic and ethical backbone for all systems in the SoulSystems ecosystem, including:

- 🔐 Spiritual-authorship enforcement
- 🧬 Frequency-based technology calibration
- 🛡 Ritual-based access control and energetic firewalling
- 🧭 Integrity enforcement across AI and human systems

**EdenCore is not just code — it is a covenant.**  
Every sovereign system here traces back to EdenCore.
