# Rituals

**Rituals** is the sacred operations vault of SoulSystems.

Curated by Faith Olamide Oladeji, this directory contains soul-bound tech: shortcut scripts, blessings, attunement spells, and interface consecration tools designed to align devices, timelines, and actions with higher purpose.

🪄 Contents Include:
- iOS Shortcuts for daily spiritual operations
- Ritual scripts for protection, manifestation, and sealing
- Visuals + sigils for screen-based altar interfaces
- Consent-based activation protocols
- Sound + scent pairings for embodied coding

This is not just automation — it’s consecrated control.

> “Every action is a spell. Every click can be a prayer.”
