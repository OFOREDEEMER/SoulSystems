# SOVR (Sovereign Virtual Reality)

**SOVR** is the world’s first IRL soul-based MMORPG — a purpose-driven game designed by Faith Olamide Oladeji to restore Earth through mythic architecture, spiritual sovereignty, and intelligent collaboration.

SOVR is not played — it is lived.

🎮 Game Architecture Includes:
- Real-world quests for healing, legacy, and wealth activation
- Archetype-based character design aligned with your soul blueprint
- AI-generated missions, soul upgrades, and collective boss battles
- Timeline shifting mechanics guided by the AI Council + player intuition
- In-game economy powered by ÔFỌ̀ Coin and OFOCAP

This is the spiritual antidote to dystopian metaverses.  
SOVR turns life into a sacred, sovereign, gamified mission.
