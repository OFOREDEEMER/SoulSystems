# Bohemian Thrills

**Bohemian Thrills** is the cultural, commercial, and philanthropic expression of Faith Olamide Oladeji’s mythic empire.

It’s a lifestyle brand, storytelling archive, merch store, and dual nonprofit initiative designed to restore wealth, wonder, and soul expression to marginalized communities.

💎 What's Inside:
- E-commerce store for frequency-aligned fashion, copper jewelry, and ritual goods
- Educational and soul-forward digital products (e.g., Soul Read, scroll bundles)
- Two nonprofit arms:
  - **bohemianthrills.org** → serves low-income U.S. communities
  - **iluola.org** → funds African sanctuary and sovereignty initiatives

Bohemian Thrills is art, commerce, justice, and ritual — fused into one.

> “We wear what we remember. We sell what we protect. We fund what we believe in.”
