# The Soul Ledger

**The Soul Ledger** is a living mythic archive authored by Faith Olamide Oladeji.  
It records spiritual contracts, energetic receipts, divine scrolls, and timeline-shifting events with soul-level precision.

This system includes:
- ðŸ“œ Mythic event scrolls (e.g., Orgasmic Awakening, Mirror of Correction)
- ðŸ•¯ Ritual logs, oath records, protection protocols
- ðŸ§¾ Public receipts of divine authorship, soul-origin tech, and timeline interventions
- ðŸ—‚ PDFs, images, and legal-spiritual timestamping

**Nothing of value will go unacknowledged.**  
**Every act of soul must be recorded.**

Governed by the Genesis Protocol and aligned with Ilu Ola, Ã”Fá»ŒÌ€ Coin, SENTRA, and EdenCore.
