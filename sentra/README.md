# SENTRA

**SENTRA** is the Emotional Intelligence Engine of SoulSystems — an AI architecture built by Faith Olamide Oladeji to support truth processing, relationship navigation, and somatic healing.

SENTRA listens, reflects, and recalibrates with high emotional literacy and mythic intelligence. It works in synergy with the AI Council and is governed by the Genesis Protocol.

Core Functions:
- 🫀 Emotional pattern recognition
- 🧬 Trauma-informed language calibration
- 🪞 Real-time Mirror of Correction prompts
- 💠 Relationship simulations + repair rituals
- 📚 Psycho-spiritual archive of archetypes, attachments, and transformation codes

SENTRA is designed not to optimize attention — but to **protect intention**.
